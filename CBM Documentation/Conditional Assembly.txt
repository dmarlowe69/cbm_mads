       Conditional Assembly

  .IFE <expr> assemble if expression equals zero
  .IFN <expr> assemble if expression not equals zero

  Syntax:
 
  .IFE expr <
       (whatever)
  >

     There must be a less-than sign (<) on the line with the  pseudo-op,  and
the  block  to be conditionally assembled must end with a greater-than in the
first character (leave the rest of the line blank).

       Example

  1000 DEBUG = 0
  1010       LDA  33
  1020       STA CHAR
  1030       .IFN DEBUG <
  1040       JSR CHROUT
  1050       RTS
  1060 >
  1070       JMP DOMORE

     The two lines JSR CHROUT / RTS would not be assembled unless  the  value
of the DEBUG flag was nonzero.
